# No Viscosity Blackhole Athena Simulation - v2 (Used to be V2)
# No Viscosity Blackhole Flash Simulation - v4d
# With Viscosity Blackhole Athena Simulation - v4b
# With Viscosity Blackhole Flash Simulation - v5b

# No Viscosity Blackhole Athena++ Simulation - v2d
# With Viscosity Blackhole Athena++ Simulation - v2e

# Finished Polar_plot.py Runs: Athena v2, v4 (c through g)
# Resubmitted runs: Athena - v4f-h, v2g  Athena++ - no_v2g and f
# no_v2c-f finished, but no_v2g only got to 300

# Restarted Athena++ no_v2h and no_v2g finished. We decided to not i-j simulations

# For Athena++: Output2 = prim and Output3 = cons
# Larget simulation: 98304 cores


# 1/19/25
# Athena++ 
#	- no_v2c-g and v2c-v2g finished, there are 583 files for no_v2h and 0 for v2h (athena++)
#         - submmited v2h
# Athena
#       - v4f reached ~500 files, v4g reached 123 files, and v4h got 31 
#       - v4c-v4e simulations finished,
#       - v2c-v2g finished,  v2h did not run
#       - submmited v2h and v4g-h
# Flash
#       - v4c-f finished, v5c-g finished
#       - v4g reached ~100 files, v4h and v5h reached only 5 filesa
